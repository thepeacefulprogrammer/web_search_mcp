# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Web Search MCP Server

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the enhancement of our existing web search MCP server to become the most comprehensive and feature-rich web search tool for AI agents. Currently, our server provides basic DuckDuckGo search results (titles, URLs, snippets), but AI agents conducting research need deeper capabilities: full content extraction, visual context through screenshots, and intelligent crawling. This enhancement will transform our server from a "search results aggregator" into a "comprehensive web intelligence platform" while maintaining our existing enterprise-grade architecture (OAuth 2.1, multi-transport, session management).

The enhanced server will serve as the foundation for future deep research MCP servers and other AI applications requiring rich web content analysis.

## Goals

1. **Become the Most Feature-Rich MCP Search Server**: Surpass existing solutions (nickclyde, oevortex, DuckDuckResearch) in both breadth and depth of capabilities
2. **Enable Comprehensive Content Extraction**: Provide full webpage content, not just search result snippets
3. **Add Visual Intelligence**: Capture and analyze webpage screenshots for visual context
4. **Implement Smart Crawling**: Follow links intelligently to gather comprehensive information
5. **Maintain Enterprise Standards**: Preserve existing OAuth 2.1, multi-transport, and session management features
6. **Optimize for AI Agent Workflows**: Design APIs specifically for AI research and analysis tasks
7. **Ensure Backward Compatibility**: Enhance existing search functionality without breaking current implementations

## User Stories

### Primary User: AI Research Agent
- **As an AI research agent**, I want to extract full article content from search results so that I can analyze complete information, not just snippets
- **As an AI research agent**, I want to capture screenshots of webpages so that I can understand visual layouts, charts, and images that complement textual content
- **As an AI research agent**, I want to follow related links automatically so that I can gather comprehensive information on a topic without manual intervention
- **As an AI research agent**, I want structured metadata extraction so that I can understand content hierarchy, publication dates, and author information

### Secondary User: Deep Research MCP Server
- **As a deep research MCP server**, I want to delegate comprehensive web searches so that I can focus on analysis and synthesis rather than data collection
- **As a deep research MCP server**, I want rich content with both text and visual elements so that I can provide complete research reports
- **As a deep research MCP server**, I want intelligent crawling capabilities so that I can automatically discover related sources and build comprehensive knowledge bases

## Functional Requirements

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Enhancements
- **Headless Browser Integration**: Implement Playwright or Puppeteer for JavaScript rendering and screenshots
- **Content Extraction Pipeline**: Multi-stage processing (fetch → render → extract → clean → structure)
- **Async Processing**: All extraction operations must be non-blocking with proper async/await patterns
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large content and images with streaming where possible
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback mechanisms for failed extractions or screenshots

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Basic search results within 2 seconds, full extraction within 10 seconds

- **Content Sanitization**: Clean extracted HTML to prevent XSS or injection attacks
- **Resource Limits**: Timeout protection for hanging requests (30-second max)
- **User Agent Rotation**: Vary user agents to avoid detection as automated traffic

### Integration Requirements
